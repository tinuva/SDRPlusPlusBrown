## Debugging reminders

* to debug in windows in virtualbox env, download mesa opengl32.dll from https://downloads.fdossena.com/Projects/Mesa3D/Builds/MesaForWindows-x64-20.1.8.7z
* make sure you put rtaudiod.dll in the build folder's root otherwise audio sink will not load.
* use system monitor to debug missing dlls while they fail to load.

## Local Android build:

* put into your ~/.gradle/gradle.properties this line: sdrKitRoot=/home/user/SDRPlusPlus/android-sdr-kit/sdr-kit
  * it can obtained + built from: https://github.com/AlexandreRouma/android-sdr-kit 
  * docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t android-sdr-kit  .
  * docker start android-sdr-kit    # it will exit
  * docker cp be03210da56a:/sdr-kit .    # will create directory with built binary libs, replace be03210da56a with id obtained from 'docker ps -a'
* use jdk11 for gradle in android studio. Android Studio -> Settings -> ... -> Gradle -> Gradle JDK . This is needed if you have various errors with java.io unaccessible fields.
* in case of invalid keystore error (should not happen with jdk11): 
  * you may create new keystore with current jdk version:
    ~/soft/jdk8/bin/keytool -genkey -v -keystore debug2.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
  * use this filename (debug2.keystore) in app/build.gradle along with passwords in the signingConfigs -> debug section.

Good luck.
